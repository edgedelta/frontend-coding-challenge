# Edge Delta Coding Challenge

### Overview

It's time for the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, and you've been tasked with creating a simple web app that each team can use to select their player. There are 32 teams, and 32 available players to be drafted. Each team has 10 seconds to make their selection. The draft is over when all 32 teams have selected a player.

### Requirements

1. Each team has 10 seconds to make their selection. The timer should be visible in the UI. If the time runs out, the team currently on the clock will automatically get the next available player.
2. Teams can only pick players from the available players list. If a player has already been selected, he now belongs to that team and can't be selected by another team.
3. Every team should be visible in the UI, with their selected player displayed (if they've picked one). The selected player's overall draft position should be visible next to their name (#1, #2, #3, etc).
4. The UI should be somewhat visually appealing. You don't need to go find logos for the teams, but a well thought-out layout will give us a good idea of your CSS skills.

**Bonus Points**
Get as crazy as you want with the challenge. The players have a decent amount of information on them. Use it in whatever way you see fit!
